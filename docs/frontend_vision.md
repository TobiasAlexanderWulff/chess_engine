# Chess Web GUI Vision

## Purpose
- Provide a north star for the standalone `chess_web_gui` repository that will
  consume this engine's HTTP API.
- Align product, design, and engineering teams on user goals, experience
  pillars, and technical integration constraints.
- Document assumptions about future enhancements so the frontend can evolve in
  lockstep with the engine roadmap.

## Audience
- Product managers defining the scope of the first public release.
- UX and visual designers shaping information hierarchy and interaction
  patterns.
- Frontend engineers implementing the SPA and integration tests.
- Developer advocates maintaining documentation and onboarding flows for
  contributors.

## Vision Statement
Deliver a fast, insightful, and trustable chess experience that showcases the
engine's analytical strengths while remaining approachable to casual players.
The application should feel responsive on consumer hardware, embrace modern web
accessibility standards, and provide progressive disclosure of advanced engine
telemetry.

## Target Personas
1. **Learner** – casual player exploring openings and tactics, values clarity,
   explanations, and guardrails against mistakes.
2. **Competitor** – club-level player preparing for matches, cares about
   accuracy, move quality, and deep analysis controls.
3. **Enthusiast** – engine aficionado interested in raw telemetry, configurable
   search parameters, and experimentation with different positions.

## Experience Pillars
- **Clarity** – prioritize readable board states, move histories, and
  annotations. Surface engine opinions with context (centipawns, mate
  distances, principal variation) and explain discrepancies across iterations.
- **Responsiveness** – minimize perceived latency by optimistic UI updates,
  streaming analysis updates, and caching recent sessions. All critical flows
  should remain usable on mid-range laptops and tablets.
- **Trustworthiness** – mirror the engine's structured errors, request IDs, and
  version metadata so users can trace unexpected behavior and share actionable
  bug reports.
- **Extensibility** – keep architecture modular (board, controls, insights) to
  accommodate future features such as puzzles, coach mode, or cloud save.

## Feature Roadmap (Initial Release)
1. **Session Management**
   - Create, resume, and destroy sessions via `POST /api/games` and subsequent
     calls.
   - Persist the current `game_id` locally (e.g., IndexedDB) so refreshes retain
     context until the backend resets.
2. **Interactive Board**
   - Drag-and-drop and tap-to-move interactions with move validation backed by
     `GET /api/games/{game_id}/state` and `POST /api/games/{game_id}/move`.
   - Highlight legal moves, last move, checks, and checkmates using state
     payload fields.
3. **Analysis Controls**
   - Quick actions for depth-limited and time-limited searches calling
     `POST /api/games/{game_id}/search` with presets (blitz/classical/custom).
   - Display engine score, mate distance, principal variation, nodes, and
     selective depth as the search progresses.
4. **History & Undo**
   - Scrollable move list with SAN/lan toggles and ability to step back using
     `POST /api/games/{game_id}/undo` and corresponding state refreshes.
5. **Position Tools**
   - FEN import/export dialog, board reset, and quick-start templates. Validate
     FEN strings client-side before calling `POST /api/games/{game_id}/position`.
6. **Insights Panel**
   - Collapsible telemetry section exposing TT stats, iterative deepening
     breakdown (`iters`), and hash usage (`hashfull`) for advanced users.
7. **Perft Playground (Developer Mode)**
   - Hidden or authenticated screen invoking `POST /api/perft` for debugging
     move generation discrepancies.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Cloud-backed session persistence keyed by user identity to survive backend
  restarts.
- Collaborative analysis mode with shared cursors and commentary.
- Opening explorer and endgame tablebase integrations.
- Mobile-first layout optimizations and offline-first caching strategies.
- Accessibility improvements such as screen-reader move announcements and
  high-contrast themes.

## Architectural Principles
- **Single Page Application** built with a modern framework (React, Svelte, or
  Vue) using TypeScript for type safety against the OpenAPI schema.
- **State Management** via a predictable store (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Pinia)
  with normalized entities for games, analysis runs, and UI panels.
- **API Layer** generated from `docs/openapi.yaml` to ensure parity with the
  backend; include clients for games, search, and perft namespaces.
- **Real-Time Feedback** using Server-Sent Events or WebSockets once the engine
  exposes streaming updates (Plan 5 backlog). For now, poll search endpoints at
  a cadence aligned with `movetime_ms` or depth iterations.
- **Testing Strategy** combining unit tests (component and store), contract
  tests against a mocked API server, and end-to-end scenarios using Playwright
  or Cypress.

## Error Handling & Observability
- Surface backend-provided `error.code`, `error.message`, and `request_id` in
  toast notifications and developer consoles to aid debugging.
- Gracefully handle `404 game not found` by prompting users to start a new
  session; offer retries for transient network failures.
- Instrument telemetry (e.g., OpenTelemetry or custom hooks) to measure request
  latency, move submission success rates, and search completion rates.
- Log engine version and build metadata in a diagnostics view to aid support.

## UX Guidelines
- Keep board rendering at 60 FPS using requestAnimationFrame and memoized
  components; fallback to CSS transitions on low-end devices.
- Provide visual feedback during long searches (spinners, depth progress bars,
  estimated remaining time based on `iters`).
- Offer keyboard shortcuts for navigation (undo, redo, flip board) and ensure
  all controls have accessible names.
- Internationalize copy via a translation framework from day one to support
  multi-lingual deployments.

## Collaboration Expectations
- Maintain shared design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) across web and
  marketing surfaces to preserve brand alignment.
- Store reusable assets (SVG pieces, icons) under `packages/ui` or equivalent
  library to unblock future native clients.
- Establish CI pipelines enforcing linting, formatting, type checks, and
  integration tests before deployment.

## Deployment & Ops Considerations
- Target static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) backed by environment
  variables pointing at the engine API base URL.
- Support multiple environments (local, staging, production) via configuration
  files or runtime environment injection.
- Implement feature flags for experimental analysis options so they can ship
  dark and be toggled remotely.
- Document rollback and cache-busting procedures to ensure rapid recovery from
  faulty releases.

## Dependencies & Integration Contracts
- Align release cadence with the engine roadmap; monitor changes to
  `docs/chess-frontend-integration.md` and `docs/openapi.yaml` for contract
  updates.
- Coordinate with backend maintainers when introducing long-running requests or
  higher concurrency loads.
- Version the generated API client alongside the backend commit hash to trace
  compatibility.

## Success Metrics
- Time-to-first-move under 5 seconds for new visitors on broadband.
- Search result latency within ±10% of requested `movetime_ms` presets.
- ≥90% of error dialogs include actionable guidance sourced from backend
  messages.
- User satisfaction (post-session survey) averages ≥4/5 on clarity and
  responsiveness.

## Open Questions
- Should streaming analysis be prioritized over deeper synchronous searches in
  MVP?
- What authentication model (if any) is required for hosted deployments?
- How should puzzles and coaching content integrate with engine analysis flows?
- Do we need offline support beyond graceful network failure handling?
